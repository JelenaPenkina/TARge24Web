    <h1>Planting Guide</h1>
    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        Magnolia is an ancient genus. Fossilized specimens of M. acuminata 
        have been found dating to 20 million years ago (mya), and fossils 
        of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 mya. 
        They are theorized to have evolved to encourage pollination by beetles
        as they existed prior to the evolution of bees.Another aspect of Magnolia
        considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is 
        enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are 
        undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. 
        Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering 
        plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage, such as Amborella and 
        Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants, such as Lilium).
        The magnolia was made the state flower of Mississippi in 1900.

    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <p>
        The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions.
        The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe 
        (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, 
        which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, 
        the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup 
        Ranunculus acris. In ornamental gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.

        Buttercups usually flower in the spring, but flowers may be found throughout the 
        summer, especially where the plants are growing as opportunistic colonizers, 
        as in the case of garden weeds.

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        Tulips are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes in 
        the Tulipa genus. Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly 
        coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white. They often have 
        a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals, internally. Because 
        of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of 
        cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip 
        is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, 
        where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, 
        and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.There are about 75 species, and these are 
        divided among four subgenera. The name "tulip" is thought to be derived 
        from a Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to resemble
        by those who discovered it.
