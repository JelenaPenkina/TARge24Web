            This latest-generation bike has a longer reach, slacker head angle and steeper seat angle than the previous model.
            This means a 460mm reach (Large), slack-for-XC 67-degree head angle and a 74.3-degree effective seat angle.The seat
            angle isn't steep per se, but will steepen a touch when the fork sags, and is on a par with many other XC hardtails.
            Chainstay lengths range from 430mm to 440mm across the five sizes, which includes an ML offering great for those 
            middle-of-the-bell-curve folk who sit between a Medium and Large.
