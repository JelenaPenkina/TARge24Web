            CycleLane is a smart, safe solution that provides a visual separation between
            vehicle and bicycle lanes. Constructed of recycled rubber, CycleLane curbing 
            is designed to define traffic spaces while protecting the safety of bicyclists. 
            Ideal for use anywhere with bike traffic, the lane delineators separate vehicle 
            and bike traffic, with a unique two sided design.
