            In the sport of road cycling, a chain gang is a group of cyclists in a close knit formation usually of two parallel lines drafting behind the leader.
            The formation comes from the fact that it is harder to cycle at the front of a group than in the shelter of another rider. The rider behind enjoys 
            the slipstream of the rider in front. If one rider were to stay at the front all the time, they would tire and the whole group would slow down. 
            If the lead is rotated, the effort is distributed across the group and the speed can be higher or the individual effort less.
