            The veloheld bike shows how pure cycling can be. It was renounced of all unnecessary things like gear shift or excessive graphics.
            A short wheelbase, a single gear and a narrow handlebar are the only equipment you need to explore the city. The creators of the 
            veloheld, among them a former member of the track race national team, reduce their bikes to the absolutely necessary parts. 
            Furthermore they offer them in two minimalistic colour versions: the white-model, only contrasting by some black components and 
            the black model where even the smallest nut is all black.
