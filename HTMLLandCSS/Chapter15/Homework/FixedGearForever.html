            Fixies offer simplicity that harkens back to the earliest days of cycling
            when one gear was common. Because your feet are directly connected to the 
            rear wheel, which drives the pedals around, your pedal stroke becomes nearly 
            perfect and with no dead spot in the stroke, you are more efficient.
