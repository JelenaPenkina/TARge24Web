            An enduro bike is often the most ridden bike for downhill racers. 
            Its the bike that we train on, go out during the week with our friends on, 
            and go ride the big backcountry trails on. So we wanted to make sure we 
            felt comfortable switching from our DH bikes to the enduro.
